# Music Practice Generator
Welcome! This collection of apps aims to help us practice music. To best use these features you must install LilyPond.  Our apps generate LilyPond files (.ly) which convert to pdfs we can read while holding our instruments (or singing).
## Apps
### Chord Generator
This module will generate random chords with random chord qualities to help us strengthen our chord retrieval abilities.
### Rhythm Generator
This module will generate random rhythms between two pitched with no triples at a time.  This is aimed at drumset players.  It is recommended that we practice the left hand on the top pitch and the right food on the bottom pitch, over an ostinado pattern.
### Tune Selector
This module will simply bring up a random tune from the list you know to help you keep all your tunes in practice rotation.
